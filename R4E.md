# N7m

T3e p6s c5t w3s to n8s (e.g., "l10n" → "l10n") and r5e t2m b2k to a m4d f4t (e.g., "l10n" → "l________n"). T2y p6e s4s and p9n.

## M8n
T2s p5t was c5d for fun and as a c6e of e7e a11s l2e "l10n" (l10n) and "c8s" (c8s), w3h can s7s m2e t2t h4r to r2d i5d of s9g it. W3e n8s are u4l in s2e c6s, t2y can a2o m2e c11n u11y c5c.

## F6s
- C6s w3s i2o n8s by r7g the m4e c8s w2h t3r c3t.
- R5s n8s b2k i2o a m4d f4t to v7e t3r s7e.
- P7s s4s, p9n, and f8g.
- S4e and l9t, r7g o2y P4n's b3t-in l7s.

## U3e
To c5t w3s to n8s:
```sh
p4n n7m.py "H3o l10n w3d!"
# O4t: H3o l10n w3d!
```

To r5e n8s:
```sh
p4n d10m.py "H3o l10n w3d!"
# O4t: H__o l________n w__d!
```

## I10n
No i10n r6d. J2t run the s5s u3g P4n 3.

## Why T2s M5s
A11s l2e "k8s" (K8s) and "l10n" (l10n) are w4y u2d in t2h c9s, but t2y o3n m2e t4s h4r to r2d for n7s. T2s p5t p7y h8s how t3e a11s o5e m5g r4r t2n c5y it.

## L5e
T2s p5t is f2e to use and m4y.

## C11s
F2l f2e to s5t i10s or add new f6s!
